            Device Detection will automatically fetch devices from official devices list
            and it will match with the current device which you are browsing on. If your device got found in officials
            then it will directly provide you latest build available which was updated by your device maintainer.

                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Redmi 4X(santoni) and Redmi 4 Prime(markw) are conflicting so if detection fails to show you correct device
                    then you have to manually navigate to Downloads section to get the build.
